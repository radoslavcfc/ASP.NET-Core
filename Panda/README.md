# ASP.NET-Core

This is started as from a small home work task from Soft Uni, but a little bit extended with my own ideas to increase functionality and knowledge scope. I am doing daily testings of anything new I discover in the rich world of ASP.NET Core 3.1. Please bear in mind, that the main purpose of this project is not to deliver a finnished platform. I am only using it to try different techniques and method for achieving different functionalities. You may notice that the code is inconsistent, but I'd like to ensure you that I am aware of the importance of the code consistency.
